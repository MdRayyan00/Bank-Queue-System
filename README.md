# Bank Queue System

In this project we examine and determine the difference between the implementaion of Queue using Array list and Linked list in banking processes.

We used the bank transaction data from kaggle to implement our findings and improvements.




## How to Run
There are 2 methods to use the code:

1- Open TransactionSettlementProcessUsingQueue.java or TransactionSettlementProcessUsingList.java in https://github.com/MRayyan00/BankQueueSystemAssignment1/tree/master/src/main/java/runner and run them.

2 - Use the code (mvn exec:java) if you have maven installed.
